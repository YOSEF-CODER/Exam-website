# Credits
The team consists of six members from Addis Ababa Science and Technology University. The team believed that digital exams offered advantages such as auto-marking and integrated tools and could eliminate problems like illegible handwriting and excessive paper waste. At the time, few digital exam platforms existed, and the ones that did felt over-complicated and out of touch with a teacherâ€™s real needs in the classroom. Determined to find a solution that worked in the real world for teachers, our  team decided to build this website.

Our team consists of
1. Yohannes Assefa
2. Yohannes Teshome  
3. Yohannes Mesganaw
